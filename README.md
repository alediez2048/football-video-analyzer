# Football Video Analyzer

## Project Description

Football Video Analyzer is an innovative AI-powered application that transforms the way we analyze and experience football matches. This cutting-edge tool leverages computer vision and machine learning technologies to automatically process football game footage, providing detailed insights and generating engaging commentary.

### Key Features:

1. **Player Detection and Tracking**: Utilizes state-of-the-art YOLO object detection to identify and track players throughout the match.

2. **Ball Tracking**: Implements advanced algorithms to follow the ball's movement, crucial for understanding game dynamics.

3. **Possession Analysis**: Calculates and visualizes ball possession statistics for teams and individual players.

4. **Event Detection**: Identifies key events such as passes, shots on target, and fouls (future development).

5. **Automated Commentary Generation**: Transforms detected events into natural language commentary, providing a rich, text-based narrative of the game (future development).

6. **Voice Synthesis**: Converts generated commentary into audio, mimicking the style of famous football commentators (future development).

### Technology Stack:

- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- Frontend: React.js
- AI/ML: YOLO, OpenCV, PyTorch
- Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas

### Target Audience:

- Football analysts and coaches
- Sports media and broadcasting companies
- Football enthusiasts and fantasy league players
- Sports betting analysts

Football Video Analyzer aims to revolutionize sports analysis by making advanced statistics and insights accessible to a wider audience. Whether you're a professional analyst looking for detailed performance metrics or a fan wanting to relive the excitement of a match through AI-generated commentary, this tool offers a unique and valuable perspective on the beautiful game.

Join us in shaping the future of sports technology!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
